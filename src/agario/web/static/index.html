    <h2>How to play:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use arrow keys or "WASD" to move your player around the map and get bigger.</li>
        <li>You, the blue circle, can get bigger by eating food and eliminating players.</li>
        <li>Eliminate players of a smaller size by chasing them and consuming them.</li>
        <li>Once one player reaches critical mass, that player wins, and a new game begins.</li>
        <li>Note: Food is worth .1 "mass", and players are worth 10% of eliminated players "mass"</li>
    </ul>
